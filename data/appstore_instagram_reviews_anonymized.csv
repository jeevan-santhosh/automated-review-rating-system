1,1,"When I want to share any stories, posts or reels, the list of friends is an utterly illogical order! People I interact with daily are 30th and beyond in the list and suddenly accounts I don‚Äôt ever interact with are in the top 10 in the list. Fix this, Meta!"
2,4,I have been using the app for a week now. I can see my friends posting pictures of like their families and cats and stuff. Pretty cool.
3,1,"Instagram, was ist nur mit euch los? Es ist frustrierend geworden, Instagram Storys oder Reels in einem durchgehenden Zug anzusehen. Jedes Mal, wenn ich mir jegliche Art von Videos anschaue, wird es nach ein paar Sekunden unterbrochen und neu gestartet. Und das Schlimmste? Ich kann nicht einmal zu dem Punkt vorspulen, an dem sie unterbrochen wurde. Das ist absolut untragbar! Dieser Fehler macht mich nerv√∂s, ver√§rgert und nimmt mir jegliche Lust, Instagram √ºberhaupt zu √∂ffnen. Ich hoffe wirklich, dass sich das mit der Zeit verbessert, aber es sind schon viele Monate vergangen, und ich kann nicht glauben, dass wir immer noch damit k√§mpfen m√ºssen. Bitte k√ºmmert euch darum! Danke!"
4,1,Die neue Schriftart ist so unglaublich h√§sslich.
5,1,Null zufrieden darum gel√∂scht
6,3,"Egal was ich tu, welche Tipps ich anwende , es hat eine soo schlechte Qualit√§t!"
7,2,"Hello Instagram I can‚Äôt see when anyone is online, although I have this feature enabled. I quickly turned on Instagram, it slows me down a lot, it infuriates me, please turn it on. I can't. I really need to know, very important, who was online when. Why does this feature exist if it doesn't work?"
8,3,Es sieht sehr schlecht aus wie die Likes nun angezeigt werden. Vorher war es deutlich besser.
9,1,DM‚Äòs not working anymore. They are just loading and never show up. I have the newest version and it‚Äòs still not working.
10,3,Ich nehme an dass das ein neues Feature ist von instagram aber das ist echt behindert muss ich sagen. Man kann wenn man auf der foryou page ist und auf ein beitrag klickt nicht mehr nach unten scrollen um mehr/√§hnliche Beitr√§ge zu sehen. Ich mein ich habe viele unn√∂tige features gesehen aber das ist jetzt ehrlich unn√∂tig vom √ºnn√∂tigsten bitte macht das wie es davor war   Danke
11,2,"Die Instagram App wird immer schlechter und man bekommt immer weniger von seinen Freunden und immer mehr Werbung und Inhalte, die einem vielleicht interessieren angezeigt.
Es ist ein Witz, dass man immer noch keine App f√ºr das iPad auf die Reihe bekommen hat, obwohl das neue iPad Pro bessere Fotos als viele Smartphone Kameras macht. Jede kleine Softwareklitsche kann Apps publizieren, die auf dem iPhone und iPad laufen, nur die Meta-Tochter ist zu bl√∂de dazu.
Au√üerdem scheinen viele Bewertungen hier gefaket zu sein. Es kann nicht sein, dass so viele offensichtlich unzufriedene Kunden 5* geben."
12,1,"Nicht nur, dass man Werbung, die einem ‚Äûnicht mehr angezeigt wird‚Äú, weiter angezeigt bekommt, jetzt werden auch noch alte Beitr√§ge wiederholt angezeigt, die man sogar teilweise schon geliked hat! Heute ist der 08.02.24 und ich bekomme Beitr√§ge vom 21. 01.24, 30.01.24 etc üò°Was soll dieser Unsinn? Das erinnert mich stark an Facebook, da gab es auch √ºberhaupt keine Timeline, einer der Gr√ºnde, warum ich FB nicht mehr nutze!

Update 20.03.24: Jetzt wird nicht mal mehr angezeigt, dass Kommentare unter dem Beitrag stehen oder ggf. wieviele? Wird alles nur noch schlechter und schlechter und schlechter! Ist das gewollt, dass die Nutzer nur noch genervt sind? Zielt es darauf ab, dass sie sich die Bezahlversion zulegen?"
13,4,"Warum sind keine Notizen mehr bei mir, was soll das?"
14,2,"Sieht seit heute alles komisch aus in dem Bereich wo man neue Sachen entdecken kann‚Ä¶ Bitte lasst es doch einfach wie es vorher war. 
Au√üerdem kann ich, wenn ich reels speichern will diese nicht direkt in einem bestimmten Ordner speichern‚Ä¶. Das war so eine tolle Funktion. Warum sowas entfernen?"
15,3,Viele Stories von Personen sind nicht mehr aufgelistet
16,1,Nur am h√§ngen und abst√ºrzen diese drecks App
17,3,"Kommentare werden nicht mehr angezeigt. 2-Faktoren-Authentifizierung via SMS funktioniert nicht bei unbekannten Ger√§ten /Browsern, weil die SMS nicht ankommt, Backup-Codes gehen auch nicht. Bugs an allen Ecken und Enden. Please fix it!"
18,1,"Beim Scrollen ist irgendwann Schluss. Es werden keine neuen Beitr√§ge geladen. Und das schon seit Wochen. Keine Lust auf Beta- Tester. 
IP12 iOS17.4"
19,1,Darkmode shows not black background anymore it‚Äôs now a darker shape of blue‚Ä¶ WHY?! Give black back!
20,3,"Normalerweise werden die Leute, denen ich folge, mir bei meinen story Ansichten immer bis oben angezeigt, seit gestern aber komischerweise nicht mehr und das st√∂rt mich enorm, weil ich √ºber 7000 Leute habe, die meine story schauen, aber ich gerne wissen m√∂chte wer von den Leuten, die ich abonniert habe, meine story sehen. 
Ich m√∂chte nicht runter scrollen √ºber 7000 Leute hinweg, also bitte √§ndert das wieder"
21,1,Seit dem gestrigen Update fehlen mir die zwei extrem wichtigen Funktionen des Planens und des Collab-Posts. Bitte schnellstm√∂glich wiederbringen üôÅ
22,1,Versuche seit Tagen mein Account zu deaktivieren geht aber nicht. Es hei√üt versuch es sp√§ter noch einmal:/
23,1,"Fast jeder Kommentar wird mittlerweile als Spam gel√∂scht. Diskussionen? Unm√∂glich. Jemanden sagen, dass ein Bild toll ist? SPAM! 
Aber Accounts von Kindern melden, die sich in eindeutigen Posen pr√§sentieren ‚Äúdanke f√ºr‚Äôs Melden, aber wir erkennen keinen Versto√ü gegen unsere Richtlinien.‚Äù Schlecht f√ºr zivilisierten Austausch, aber eine echte Empfehlung f√ºr Pedos. Good Job Meta.. nicht!"
24,1,"Seit Wochen nur noch Probleme.... Feed wird nicht korrekt geladen Bzw gar nicht (oft nicht mal der eigene), Likes die man gegeben hat verschwinden nach einer Sekunde einfach wieder, folgen wird grundlos gesperrt. Als Fotograf ist das einfach Mega schlecht wenn man neue Kunden gewinnen will oder sich mit anderen Fotografen connecten m√∂chte. Hauptsache die ganzen Fake Influencer k√∂nnen sich weiter ihre Follower und Likes kaufen!!! Toll Instagram du warst mal geil"
25,1,"Ich kann seit etwa 2 Jahren keine Werbung schalten. Auch der pers√∂nliche Support konnte nicht helfen (f√ºr den man jeden Monat zahlt) 
Arbeitstechnisch eine Null Nummer"
26,2,seit 2 Wochen funktioniert insta unter mobilen Daten nicht mehr. Nur noch √ºber wlan
27,3,"Please re-activate my account @sergeisr_
It was deactivated and since then I can‚Äôt use Instagram anymore"
28,3,"Keine Ahnung wer auf die Idee gekommen ist, dieses Aufloppen vom Top-Comment eines Reels zeitlich am Anfang des Reels zu tun. Seitdem werd ich immer gespoilert und Reels schauen ist nicht mehr geniessbar. Bitte beheben oder eine Einstellung einf√ºhren, wo man selbst entscheiden kann."
29,1,"Achtung, Privatsph√§re! Profil auf privat und trotzdem sehen sich User meine Story an au√üerhalb meiner Freundesliste. Wie geht das?!"
30,3,"Leider vermindert sich seitdem die Reichweite sich ge√§ndert hat: Hashtags nicht mehr wie vorher ‚ÄûAktuelle‚Äú sondern ‚ÄûAktuelle Top Beitr√§ge‚Äú was bedeutet, das kleinen Accounts die Sichtweite genommen wird. Schade, f√ºr mich ein Argument, mich allm√§hlich zur√ºckzuziehen. Erfreulich : die unangenehmen Po..Links gibt es nicht mehr"
31,1,Seit ca 3 Monaten kann man reels nicht mehr richtig teilen. Es sieht dann so aus als k√∂nnten die Empf√§nger nicht geladen werden
32,1,Neues Update und ich kann Insta weiterhin nicht nutzen. Anmeldung unm√∂glich. Statt mal einer brauchbaren Fehlermeldung oder Hilfe kommt nichts von Meta. Was f√ºr ein M√ºll!
33,3,"am Anfang hatte ich insta meine story‚Äôs konnte ich posten alles gut Sounds konnte ich noch suchen.ABER AUFEINMAL GING NIX MHER ,und ich habe Handy heruntergefahren,App gel√∂scht und wieder installiert,usw.. aber die Sounds wenn man sie sucht kommen sie nicht ich habe ein I phone XS in Version 16.7.5 also so schlecht ist das jetzt auch nicht ."
34,1,"Jedes abgespielte Video bleibt h√§ngen. Neuinstallation der App brachte keine Besserung. Kein Wunder ist TikTok so erfolgreich, wenn bei Instagram nicht mal die Basics funktionieren."
35,1,Was machen eure Entwickler den ganzen Tag?
36,1,Bringt den GIF Button zur√ºck
37,4,"Nur, dass man gesperrt wird. Wenn man zu vielen Leuten gleichzeitig folgt, finde ich nicht gut, dass man keinen Menschen mehr folgen kann und gleich als bot abgestempelt wird"
38,5,"Ich kann keine GIFs mehr in den Kommentaren schicken, was ist das ???"
39,1,"Leider hat die App auf dem Iphone schon l√§nger Probleme. Fotos werden v√∂llig √ºberbelichtet wenn man sie als Beitrag hochl√§dt. Auf dem Ipad klappt es richtig, ebenso wenn man das gleiche Foto als Story verwendet"
40,1,Please bring back the gif option on comments.
41,1,"iOS is giving problems with many apps..on insta too.. foto or video upload, directly from the photo gallery not possible, is one of the major problem.. hope so all the bugs will get fixed"
42,1,"Seit Wochen - wieder mal - kein online-Status sichtbar! Insta speichert viel zu viele Daten auf dem iphone (etliche GB) und der Cache kann nicht gel√∂scht werden. Vor Jahren hat Insta mal Spass gemacht, das ist lange vorbei."
43,1,Man erh√§lt einfach keinen Anmeldecode f√ºr die zwei stufen Verifizierung trotz richtig angegebener Telefonnummer. Es NERVT sehr viele sollen das problem haben.
44,1,This resulted in my having to re-upload a story several times only to figure out this had been disabled by then. Very annoying bug.
45,1,"Die App flaggt seit einer Weile regelm√§√üig Kommentare als Spam, obwohl man am Tag weder sonderlich viel noch immer wieder das Gleiche (oder auch nur √Ñhnliche) kommentiert hat. Kommentare werden dann auch einfach ohne die M√∂glichkeit, das wenigstens nochmal von einer tats√§chlichen Person pr√ºfen zu lassen, entfernt. Es ist einfach nur nervig."
46,1,Story‚Äôs still messed up and shows me stuffs I don‚Äôt follow and don‚Äôt wanna see even if suggestions turned off. Like since 2 months time to delete this trash
47,3,"Wenn ein Smartphone im Stummmodus ist, hat das den Zweck, dass der Nutzer will, dass das Smartphone stumm bleibt!
Instagram: Mir egal, hiermit spiele ich trotzdem alles mit Ton ab!

Hier besteht dringend Nachbesserung! Stumm hei√üt stumm und dass das Smartphone keinen Ton von sich geben soll!"
48,1,This app is worse everyday. The dramatic reduced reach and glitches ruined everything for small creators.
49,1,"Save your time and your kids, this apps don‚Äôt allow the truth to come to surface."
50,1,"Nach dem
Update geht der Live Status nicht mehr!

Die Notizen sind weg!

√úberpr√ºft keiner von euch die Updates bevor ihr sie raus haut?

üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ"
51,1,Wo GIF Button?
52,2,"Euer Algorithmus ergibt keinen Sinn. Ich habe nie ein t√ºrkische Video angeguckt, oder folge einem Kanal und pl√∂tzlich kommen nur noch Videos auf T√ºrkisch oder vom t√ºrkischen Fu√üball, wo das Video aber auch auf T√ºrkisch ist. Das gleiche mit chinesisch und mexikanischen Videos. ‚ÄûKein Interesse‚Äú hilft √ºberhaupt nicht.

Dazu besteht es gef√ºhlt nur noch aus Scam Accounts und ‚ÄûDu willst reich werden‚Äú bla bla. 
Und nein, ich gucke und suche die nie."
53,2,"Seit dem letzten Updates funktionieren reels bei mir nicht mehr. Nach 3 sek startet das reel von vorne und weitere 3 sek sp√§ter bleibt das Bild h√§ngen, der Ton l√§uft aber weiter. 
√Ñndert aber auch nicht viel an dem Fakt, dass Instagram eine der unn√∂tigsten Arten ist, seine Zeit zu verschwenden. Keine Empfehlung von mir"
54,1,"Ich m√∂chte mir einen neuen Business Account erstellen und es klappt nicht. 
Schon mehrmals probiert. 
Das ist anstrengend. Bitte Produkt verbessern!"
55,1,"Ich habe auf mein Business Konto nur Probleme, Nachrichten verschieben sich, habe keine Organisation mehr welche Kunden im hauptordner sind, es wechselt immer in den allgemeinen. Bitte um eine schnelle Behebung, bin wirklich aufgeschmissen grade."
56,1,"Keine Transparenz, st√§ndige werbestressoren, Kinderarbeit, diverse Probleme!"
57,1,PLEASE MAKE GIFS IN THE COMMENTS I DONT WRITE I COMMENT WITH GIFS.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
58,3,"Was ist denn mit dieser App bitte los?!?!?! Es h√§ngt alles, irgendwie funktioniert nichts mehr. Ein reel oder Video startet 10x hintereinander, w√§hrend dessen h√§ngt das Bild.. üòíüòíüòí bringt es bitte in Ordnung. Danke.. 
ps. Es ist schon seit langem so. üòí"
59,1,"Since more than 2 months the problem with the sound remains unsolved. 

First I thought it was a new feature which would be pretty bad. 
But I saw that it‚Äôs actually a bag.

Always when you watch reels and listen to music in the background suddenly the sound of the reel starts to go on and the music turns of as if you have tapped on the screen. 

First I thought I tapped on the screen accidentally ore something wrong with my display. 

But no it‚Äôs a bag and it‚Äôs extremely annoying fix it finally you‚Äôre a multimillion dollar company how hard can it be to fix a sound. Problem. Ore is it maybe actually intentional?"
60,1,"Warum wurde die Funktion deaktiviert? 
Und schreibt bei euren Patchnotes mal was ihr √§ndert und nicht Copy and Paste das gleiche‚Ä¶."
61,1,Ich warte seit drei Monaten bis beim Problem behoben wird.Ich kann die App also nicht benutzenüò°
62,1,Der Speicherbedarf ist enorm. Instagram speichert unn√∂tig viel auf dem Handy. Seit Jahren wird an diesem Problem nichts ge√§ndert.
63,2,"Schade, st√§ndig h√§ngen/haken die Reels, entweder komplett, manchmal nur der Ton. Trotz mehrfacher Aktualisierungen immer noch kein bugfixing. So nervts."
64,4,muhammed.aslan4747 destek
65,1,Was auf Instagram fehlt ist Kontrolle. Wenn man sich manche Post anschaut oder die Kommentare von manchen Menschen die hass verbreiten etc. Da muss dringend mal was passieren
66,1,"Es macht s√ºchtig, t√∂tet unseren Verstand und sollte zum Wohle der Menschheit verboten werden"
67,1,The amount of bugs and things not working over the last few months is something to embarrassed about considering it‚Äôs released by such a huge company. Especially the web version is awful. Would give zero stars if I could.
68,1,"Stop recommending people on my feeds. Why even, don‚Äôt recommend people option exists if it doesn‚Äôt work on iOS???  Soon, Instagram is also heading towards trash!!!"
69,5,Ithas every tool I need to tag and upload my daily Pictures
70,2,Keine GIFs mehr m√∂glich!
71,5,"1. Nach kurzer Zeit kann ich keine Posts mehr teilen da die Kontakte nicht laden. Ich muss Instagrams schlie√üen und neu √∂ffnen 
2. Laden Chat-Einladungen nicht mehr. Ich muss in den Webbrowser gehen damit ich Anfragen sehen kann
3. Wenn ich was in Entw√ºrfe hinterlege und sp√§ter fertigstelle zum posten wird der Entwurf gel√∂scht und der Beitrag nicht hochgeladen. Ich muss dann alles nochmal von vorne machen"
72,2,"Tbh I am ver disappointed from Instagram , they deleted my acc where I had everything and say I wasn‚Äôt following their community things But I did I always was helping the people who got bullied there But then they just made me the fault Plus They deleted my acc bc I was rp And they said that I tried to copy a celebrity When I was actually role playingüíÄ So yeah I had over 1k there And I had so many friends But I lost everything Bc Instagram is very supportive and helpful"
73,1,"An sich ne geile App um viel Zeit drauf zu verbringen, macht nach einer Zeit aber s√ºchtig und schneller als man gucke kann verbringt man 3h+ auf dieser App."
74,1,‚Ä¶.
75,1,"Ich habe mehrere Plattformen, wo ich mit normal WLAN wie auch ‚ÄûLTE 4G 5G‚Äú drauf, nur bei euch Instagram Der. Ihr wollt nur WLAN. Entweder ihr √§ndert das in den n√§chsten vier Wochen oder ich gehe und ich werde noch etliche mitziehen"
76,3,"Es ist einfach so d√§mlich das man ein account nach einer deaktivierung aktiviert und nach 7 tagen erst wieder deaktivieren kann. Ich bitte euch diese Funktion zu beheben. 
N√§chstes Problem, viele meiner freunde k√∂nnen ein Beitrag mit mehreren Bildern und musik posten. Leider geht es bei mir nicht & das schon seit √ºber 2 Monaten. Ich w√ºrde mich freuen wenn sie endlich mal diese ganzen Fehler beheben oder korrigieren."
77,5,üëçüëç
78,2,"Leider wird oft ein Beitrag gesperrt oder das Profil auf Grund des Namens nicht mehr empfohlen, angezweifelt, dass ein Video von einem selbst stammt‚Ä¶etc. Schade"
79,1,"Leider seit letztem Update kein Wechsel zwischen 2 Accounts mehr m√∂glich. 
Schade"
80,1,"Stop bullying the clearly superior app that TikTok is cause you are so scared of them. We will mass delete your apps. You could have coexisted but you‚Äôre just too scared, so bye."
81,1,"No views on my reels, super strange because I didn‚Äôt do anything against the rules! Can you fix it? I‚Äôve asked a lot of creators and they have the same issue!!"
82,1,"I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, but the functionality and also the algorithm is getting worse and honestly I consider to delete the app. They can try to sell their b*llsh*t somewhere else. I write about a topic and it‚Äôs no ad / spam at all, but my comments are being removed because this stupid algorithm thinks it‚Äôs spam. Using Instagram is not as funny as it used to be and instead it‚Äôs becoming more like Facebook and on it‚Äòs way to be buried in oblivion."
83,5,"Obwohl ich bei mir zuhause bin, in einer W-LAN f√§higen Umgebung, laden meine Storys nicht hoch. Das ganze ist rot hinterlegt, mit der Aufforderung die Story zu l√∂schen. Was soll das?!
Bitte so schnell wie m√∂glich beheben."

91,1,Muuuuch better
92,1,"Da baut man sein IG Profil auf, investiert unendlich viele Stunden, Tage und auch Liebe daf√ºr;
dann, als sich zeigt dass die ganze Arbeit (AI Kunst) bei andern IG Usern gut ankommt und man viele Likes bekommt, wird man vom Support schikaniert !!!
Von wegen ‚Äû Wir haben festgestellt, dass ungew√∂hnliche Aktivit√§ten auf deinem Instagram Profil stattfinden und haben daher die Nutzung deines Profiles ‚Äûvor√ºbergehend‚Äú eingeschr√§nkt‚Ä¶
Frechheit !!!! 
Ich freue mich √ºber die Likes, bitte ganz bestimmt auf Instagram niemanden darum und werde von den Support ‚Ä¶. in Irland auch noch obendrein schikaniert?
Das sollte man wirklich an die Mainstream Medien kommunizieren !
Was ist mit den Prominenten auf Instagram, zb eine Taylor Swift, Vin Diesel, Gal Gadot, usw. ? 
Die werden bestimmt nicht vom Support schikaniert !!!!"
93,1,"Have been using Instagram since 2010, and like the network and what it enables. But the recent release kills any photo taken with an iPhone 15 pro/max. And there is NO reply from Instagram support at all. This bug is exentsively documented on reddit, alas Insta doesnt seem to care."
94,3,"Die App an sich ist okay und nutzbar. Support erreicht man hier allerdings keinen, egal ob gewerblich oder private Anliegen. 
So werden zum Beispiel eigene Lieder in Storys verf√ºgbar werden aber f√ºr die Bewerbung urheberrechtlich nicht zugelassen. Hierzu hab ich den Support vor 6 Monaten angeschrieben und bis heute keinerlei R√ºckmeldung."
95,1,Beim Erstellen einen Beitrags kann kein Text aus der Zwischenablage eingef√ºgt werden!
96,2,"Seit kurzem bearbeitet Instagram meine Fotos von alleine wenn ich diese hochladen will. Das Original wird total √ºberbelichtet
Kann jemand helfen? 
iPhone 15 und IOS 17.4."
97,1,"Im Netz wird zu viel Zensiert. Kommentare werden gel√∂scht. Kritisches Denken und Meinungs√§u√üerung werden nicht zugelassen. Im Gegenteil man wird daf√ºr auch noch gesperrt. Der sch√∂ne Artikel Nr. 5 unseres Grundgesetz wird von den Amerikanern mutwillig getreten. Der Verfassungsschutz sollte sich das mal angucken.

Was ist bitte mit der Werbung los ?
Das zu viele Werbespots angezeigt werden ist schon skandal√∂s ! Es werden immer mehr betr√ºgerische Werbespots angezeigt, oder sch√§dliche. Ist das den Betreibenden so absolut schei√üegal ?!"

101,1,This is really annoying me but the message requests keep not loading up for me on Instagram and only work when I delete the app and reinstall. I‚Äôm tired of deleting the app everyday just to reinstall it
102,1,"Recently have updated my app but the bug has persisted, Cant send stories and post to anyone, it shows black circles"
103,1,I think instagram is stupid for taking away the screen share button get a life kill yourself
104,4,My gif button is back üòä
105,3,"I‚Äôm so grateful that you removed gifs, if I‚Äôm being honest the amount of racism that was demonstrated through gifs was getting out of hand it‚Äôs really saddening that people like this still exist but it‚Äôs the sad truth. So I think it was a good idea removing them."
106,1,I have reported an ad that is a scam and following a review Instagram decided not to take it down. For facilitation of fraud Instagram should be liable for all the financial losses and distress caused to vulnerable people by scammers enabled by Instagram. They know they enable fraud and don‚Äôt do anything about it.
107,1,"This platform is brutal and has no interest in supporting its content creators but if your a visitor it‚Äôs awesome you get awesome, interesting content delivered to you via exploitative platform share holders"
108,3,"There was an icon for adding music to my story before , but now I don‚Äôt have that access while my colleagues have that access"

As soon as I see ‚Äúnext reel in‚Ä¶‚Äù I instantly shut Instagram down and go to Tiktok (the far superior app)."
110,1,"This app is destroying my business, it‚Äôs a
Burden to use, all the money they must make and they can even create an app that works properly."
111,1,"You guys have broken reels, I just spent an hour making one and it just disappeared. It no longer lets me sync content with sound and does not let me access templates. And unable to report this anywhere"
112,2,I have problems with notifications layout please take a look at it except from that I like instagram and pls make it possible to make friends according to location thanks and also I have a problem with the instagram app I can see the note section anymore and when I try to actualise my messages section they say we are sorry something went wrong please try again later what‚Äôs wrong again?
113,1,"When i save a reel and try to open the saved album it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt open at all it shows me request timeout,error. Already i raised the problem in the instagram app but they didn‚Äôt solve my issue.i was reporting the issue so many days"
114,5,I can‚Äôt add song to my post anymore üëÄüëÄ
115,2,"Ever since the update on the 20.03.2024, I can no longer add music to my photo posts and now I can‚Äôt see the insights for my reels. 
Is this a update issue? Or is this a new thing that we are no longer able to do those two features anymore?"
116,1,"ive been using instagram for about 6 years now, but recently it has become utter rubbish. especially the comments. before when i went to look at comments, i could see all comments and top comments. now i can only see about 5 to 10 comments per post, and they are only the most recent comments. ive tried reporting this issue multiple times, tried fixing the issue myself (clearing cache, logging out/back in again, deleting and reinstalling etc), but nothing works. this makes the app look unorganised, ugly, and messy. this issue with the comments needs to be fixed asap."
117,1,Previous save option of posts was better
118,3,I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôve asked some of my followers and they don‚Äôt seem to see my posts. I spend a lot on advertising as I‚Äôm a small business but I‚Äôm not sure the algorithm is working for me
119,4,"Why have u changed my dark mode setting into a navy blue colour, it used to be black now it‚Äôs not, I want this changed immediately it‚Äôs so ugly and annoying"
120,5,Amazing
121,2,"The platform and its ability to connect with people, I love. The unpredictable and irrational algorithm that randomly threatens and disables the time and effort put into the feed, I hate."

123,2,BRING THE NOTES BACK
124,5,Insta is my fave 10/10
125,2,"Listen, when I‚Äôm scrolling on silent mode, that means I want my feed to be silent. When I mute a reel, I want it to stay muted. Moreover, I want all following reels to be muted until such a time I decide to unmute them. If I turn a reel down because it‚Äôs too loud, I would enjoy it if the reel continued to play at the newer, lower volume instead of fighting with me for volume supremacy

It‚Äôs a highly unpleasant scrolling experience when every 1-2 posts some new, painful audio is blasted at full volume into my ear holes. Two stars because last time I left a bad review the issue in question was fixed within a couple weeks."
126,3,"Seriously - it‚Äôs 2024: can we clear the app of junk files we don‚Äôt even know are being stored and we‚Äôre literally NEVER going to look at?
And search is forever broken."
127,1,Keeps on freezing and wont let me make an account
128,1,So I‚Äôve had instagram for about a week now and this is the second time it‚Äôs saying my account has been suspended I did all the checks the first time and had an email saying you apologise but for it to happen again when I have not done anything wrong is just a joke. Now I have to wait again for another apology. This is why I have given one star
129,4,Where‚Äôs my Gifs ????
130,2,The new changes are absolutely dreadful for small photographers to gain any reach without making thirst traps.
131,1,"There used to be an option for ‚Äú only show for‚Äù but now the only options are ,‚ÄúHide story from‚Äù And ‚Äú Close friends‚Äù

So yeahhhh not happy"

133,2,"It makes me uncomfortable to see how many humans are incredibly insecure, ungrateful and lacks basic knowledge, etc etc it truly shows the weakest of instant exposure. Thankfully, I‚Äôm not the one to worship an atom, personally never would. If you‚Äôre into plastic women, strippers and less brainless fools, you‚Äôve came across to the right social platform. You‚Äôd fallen into the glimpse of senseless thirst traps.
However I would like to suggest to add the option onto hiding/unseen the comments from other people‚Äôs posts, as this can overall damage our mindsets, i sure would hate to be influenced or manipulated otherwise. This setting can manage to make the platform more user-friendly and superior to attract appropriate outcomes."
134,1,"Also now device banned with ZERO help to solve this issue.

IOS 13.2.3 Advertising has broken recently with the addition of ‚Äúswipe up‚Äù ads. Simply just scrolling down the timeline activates these ads and then you cannot close them...have to force close each time and happens every time you open the app. The Help Centre is completely broken, its not sending pw reset codes"
135,2,For some reason Instagram have disabled GIF comments. Not cool! Bring back the gifs please üôè
136,1,I‚Äôve got an iPhone 13 Pro Max. And I‚Äôve been recently informed that there‚Äôs an emoji game in the DM‚Äôs. WHY CANT I PLAY??!??
137,3,"This app used to be great for the keen photographer. 

It‚Äôs ruined by an advert every 2-3 posts most being total rubbish. Along with Meta trying to force engagement. 

The only reason it‚Äôs not less than 3 stars is they don‚Äôt charge for it."
138,1,"Avoid if you can, they never get back to you or give you the chance to appeal anything"
139,1,"I have been using instagram for years but recently the quality of my posts is basically ruined, regardless of my camera quality or upload settings. So disappointing."
140,1,"‚ÄòBringing you closer to the people and things you love‚Äô

This is the claim of Instagram - however Instagram takes you away from the things you love - by constantly distracting you with a feed that‚Äôs designed like a fruit machine but worse that fragments attention. 

And when you have worked hard on content the algorithm suppresses it - Instagram claims to allow artistic n*dity - but in practice - a charcoal drawing of a clothed figure will trigger the algorithm to hide the post - thus reach is 1 percent of what it was 

Instagram causes burn out by distracting you and allowing you to spend time on content that is then seen by a tiny audience - so it certainly fails to bring you closer to what you love"
141,3,"I think the platform is great. The options to display my art are useful and the general layout is fairly intuitive. 
My gripe comes with the shadowbans and lack of communication around them. My account has been affected since the platform wide ban last October regarding the Palestine marches. 
As this affects my reach to my audience and therefore my income I have a huge problem with this. 

If there were transparency surrounding this and channels of communication I would be a lot more understanding."
142,2,As soon as I done the update I lost my ability to comment gifs! Can someone tell me how to fix that
143,5,"Instagram is a great inspiration to me during lockdown. Sewing and craft ideas from others have been great for me. And other people‚Äôs wonderful photos. Loving Instagram. I love Instagram. I put on a photo almost every day.

Still enjoying Instagram. Great place to share photos of days out. My books and my crafts."

148,1,"When I‚Äôm listening to sporify on my Amazon echo, I‚Äôm unable to scroll reels on insta with the sound off. As soon as I reduce the volume or mute the video, the volume automatically goes up when I scroll to the next reel. I should be able to mute the reels regardless of what I‚Äôm listening to on other devices. I now avoid browsing instagram at all costs. Such a horrible user experience that assaults my senses."

156,1,Trying to build my page but Instagram have suspended me so I can‚Äôt even add people so what‚Äôs the point
157,5,You can trust Instagram 100%. Instagram is also very helpful because for example I stayed on instagram until 12am and Instagram suggested I should go off.
158,1,"Hate logging in and seeing posts from 5 days ago.

Seeing some posts over and over and not seeing others at all.

Not even sure what Following setting is for, of course I should only be seeing following posts?!"
159,3,Mark Zuckerberg has mastered the social media realm. Instagram is a great app to use but the algorithm is underdeveloped.
160,3,"Can‚Äôt make comments with GIFs on posts anymore.

Altered photo of princess Catherine. It‚Äôs sad that you are so biased and have treated her unfairly when ALL photos on Instagram have been altered in more than one way!! 

I expect the same notice on everyone's photos moving forward.
#PrincessCatherine

The same altered photo was reviewed by independent fact-checkers in another"
166,4,So I like instagram but there‚Äôs one thing‚Ä¶the community.everyone is beefing and being toxic so I rate this app a 4
167,3,Bro where‚Äôs the gifs button for comments
168,3,Can‚Äôt comment anything anymore this app ain‚Äôt what it used to be if they continue restricting what you can say I‚Äôm uninstalling it don‚Äôt make sense and is a shame really
169,1,"The app is keep crashing and not allowing me to make or login into my account, plz help!!!"
170,4,"I love instagram. But the messages now are so annoying with that automatic color messages. I do prefer the monochrome theme. Undestand they are under META company, however they are still meant to be different apps and i truly hate the colorful themes for messages‚Ä¶"
171,2,"When i try to share any reel to my followers, all i‚Äôm seeing are circles and rectangles instead of their profile pictures and names."
172,5,I‚Äôm delighted that the social networking platform known as Instagram is generating profit and income. It is a fantastic application for everyone to use on their mobile device. Thank you.
173,1,"I have used this app since it was just a simple photo editor, I‚Äôve shared my photos on here for over a decade now. in that time I‚Äôve gone from amateur to professional photographer. 

Over time this app has just gotten worse and worse, there‚Äôs so little I like about it. I would uninstall if I didn‚Äôt operate a good portion of my business through their tools 

I can hardly see images from my friends, my photos are buried in peoples feeds with absolute garbage being recommended instead. 

Encouraging comments on friends photos get flagged as spam and my account temporarily suspended on a regular basis to the point I have stopped leaving comments entirely. 

There is zero and I mean zero customer support despite being a paid service! It‚Äôs absolutely wild that that is even legal. 

If they don‚Äôt do something soon to rectify it people will abandon the platform entirely."
174,1,"So apart from shadow banning people‚Äôs content and deleting people‚Äôs accounts. 
You have now, turned off the use GIF‚Äôs on people‚Äôs accounts!! Is this your ‚Äúbug fix‚Äù on the latest software update? SORT IT OUT!!"
175,5,"Insta is a good app overall. There‚Äôs something for everyone, artists, creators, fashion lovers, nature lovers, gym goers and small business supporters can all be satisfied happily with this app. There are downsides such as political censoring and accounts being blocked that limit the apps potential as it‚Äôs known free speech isn‚Äôt instagrams forte, there are certain political agendas and propaganda that instagram pushes in a manner of bias. Furthermore there are millions of bot accounts that advertise questionable and highly unethical media.
Over than those aforementioned questionable and undeniably awful downsides the app is great and it‚Äôs worth downloading.
I‚Äôve found inspiration from certain accounts and seen advice being spread that can really make a positive difference in peoples lives.
Hopefully instagram becomes more in touch with it‚Äôs users and listens to complaints and suggestions so that the app can genuinely be improved."
176,2,App bugs constantly now
177,1,Doesn‚Äôt allow you to switch between accounts. Really frustrating when I need to use work and business accounts on my one device
178,1,My app is not working i do have 3 days whith log in error i dont know why beacouse my accout its fine i can log in in my friends phone.
179,1,"Majority of the time i comment , it gets taken down as SPAM LIKE INSTAGRAM WTH?! I literally want to comment but you don‚Äôt wanna get rid of sick comments like ‚ÄúN***A‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hunting season!‚Äù. Instagram , do better."
180,1,Why all of a sudden I don‚Äôt have a GIF button and it‚Äôs changed for an arrow to post only? Update didn‚Äôt change a thing. Is this only an iPhone problem?
181,1,I‚Äôm always in IG JAIL
182,1,"Why does insta keep sending me notifications but when I check there‚Äôs nothing there?
Stop bugging"

185,1,Opened up an account but every time i try to add any hashtags it pops up saying ‚ÄúWe restrict certain activity‚Ä¶‚Äù im just posting pictures of a gameboy. Instagram is absolute toilet üòë
186,1,"Why is the algorithm auto following people I don‚Äôt follow and filtering out the people I have been following. 

Since the update I have noticed a massive difference in the stories on my feed and i  want it to stop otherwise it‚Äôs pointless having this App feed me what I don‚Äôt want."
187,2,"In the last two days, any comments that I have made, which is longer than two lines has been taken down.
I have followed all the community guidelines, and yet still, it‚Äôs telling me that I haven‚Äôt followed community guidelines when it says to press why it takes me to My account status and there is nothing there. Everything on my account is above board and I haven‚Äôt broken any rules. All my tick ‚úÖ are there.

Also, I am unable to see any comments that I have made in previous posts.
This is very disheartening.
I would like this problem fixed. I have sent information over but yet still this keeps happening. When I am reporting an issue all it says is thank you for your feedback. I wasn‚Äôt just giving feedback I was asking for help with a problem and it doesn‚Äôt say anything after sending your problem. It doesn‚Äôt give you any information that you will be in contact with you to resolve this problem.
I am not sure if this is a glitch or an update issue.
Every time I want to post something or make a comment im unsure and delete as I am unsure what Instagram is doing with my comments.
I need someone at instagram to help me with this issue. üò°"
188,3,Quiet recently the amount of ads are causing me to want to delete the app. Why do we need to see ads every 2/3 posts I scrolled 20 posts and 12 of them were ads. Come on guys it‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶

194,5,"I have been told a few times I don‚Äôt adhere to guide lines, and then wait for three weeks or when ever to use it again. For the life of me I have not been abusive. Today my instagram has disappeared. If I log into AppleStore and down load it, I can open it and back to normal, but only through applestore and not on the screen of my phone. I have asked for help, told them. The answer I get back is‚Äùthank you for your contribution üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
195,1,"My instagram has updated to show stories of people I DO NOT EVEN FOLLOW! Before my own connections! So now I jave to scroll through a load of random people I havent asked instagram to show me before I can connect with my friends stories. I hope this just a test snd they remove it! Especially as a creator with a second account struggling to get my content seen because Instagram pushing certain accounts‚Ä¶ my followers womt get to see my stories now because itll be oushed way back behind ten random accounts noone follows and noone asked for, which from my point of view would make me not want to scroll past all those accounts to get to my followers and connections."
196,1,"Getting loads of notifications come though when not on app then I go on the app click on suggestions I get one notification and the rest is suggested for you, turned off suggested for you in settings and still happening"
197,1,"This app is infiltrated with spam galore, and yet none of the true spam is ever deleted automatically. And yet when I provide genuine comments the stupid app accuses ME of spamming.

I‚Äôm very much on the verge of deleting it because the app is literally that rubbish."
198,5,Always spot on
199,1,"Given how big the market cap is on Instagram and their place in social media. How the F do you break the app so there no minimal notifications, like 2 a day it that!

280,5,"Dear Instagram Developers,
I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to bring to your attention a pressing issue that many users, including myself, have been experiencing on the platform recently.

It has come to our attention that certain songs are not available within Instagram's music library, despite their widespread availability on other platforms. This limitation is significantly hindering our ability to create engaging content and connect with our audience effectively.

As active users of Instagram, we understand the importance of music integration in enhancing the appeal and engagement of our posts and stories. However, the current unavailability of specific songs is severely limiting our creative freedom and diminishing the overall user experience.

We kindly urge you to prioritize addressing this issue and exploring potential solutions to ensure a more comprehensive and inclusive music library on Instagram. Whether it's negotiating additional music licenses, resolving licensing constraints, or improving communication with users regarding song availability, we believe prompt action is essential to maintain user satisfaction and engagement on the platform.

We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to seeing improvements in the near future. Thank you for your dedication to enhancing the Instagram experience for all!"

310,1,"The new update changed my explore page. When I choose a post on that page, I can‚Äôt scroll down to keep seeing related posts. I have to tap back and keep selecting individual posts. App is essentially useless."
311,1,"Why remove flip side after making it available for use, when we have spent time building flip side to only have it taken away with zero warning? Instagram was starting to make a comeback with flip side, now it‚Äôs garbage yet again. Unless you are an robot instagram model. Zero stars"
312,1,After the new update I can‚Äôt login to my account.
313,3,"Please allow 60fps videos.  Also, might as well sacrifice 1080p for 720p since the bitrate is too low for such high resolutions (and most users are on mobile(tiny) devices anyway)."
314,4,"Bien, mais commence √† √™tre d√©pass√©"
315,2,"i was having issues on my device seeing activity status, so i updated to the newest version to fix it, only for the new update to now have issues showing notes on my account. one bug fix makes another bug appear, make it make sense?"
316,1,"Are you ever going to fix the issue with video playing for a few seconds and then restarting over and over again? I spend about 20 seconds on this app until it becomes so frustrating I have to close it. 

I‚Äôve experience this issue for years and I‚Äôm not the only one. Check Reddit."
317,1,Over 80% of the things I post are flagged as spam despite not meeting the platform‚Äôs definition of spam. The app is basically unusable unless I want to use it as a ‚Äúview only‚Äù application which essentially renders it useless.
318,5,Such deceit
319,4,When i press the gif button nothing shows up
320,1,"Everyone of my friends have instagram notes, I only had it for 3 months and i dont have it anymore, fix this pls or tell me how to fix it!"
321,3,"IG is great for connecting with other artists! But the longer I have it, the more ads come on and squeeze the artists posting on it. I know a lot of artists in my art community have just given up as they post and it appears briefly then disappears in a black hole, never to return. Yet, we keep seeing more and more ads. It is discouraging and defeating. More and more over time, one does not find it useful."
322,1,Bring em back.
323,1,My instagram account is not working with this new update I can‚Äôt get in please do something about it
324,1,It‚Äôs been a month that i am trying to login my account in the instagram app and still it is not getting login but i try to login from browser or on anmy another phone it‚Äôs getting login. Please help in this.
325,4,"- Drafts without a time limit 
- Longer music time in stories 
- More options for stories and highlights
- Better surface for editing highlights
- Option to choose highlight stories‚Äô order regardless of date
- Option to also customize highlights‚Äô order on profile 
- Is there a way to get the pictures quality to stay good? They always seem to be reduced 
- This review is to be continued 

Thank you 
:)"
326,4,Instagram is very nice but I can not change my name. It says that I have to wait 60 days but I have waited for more than 2 months. PLZ HELP!!! üôèüôèüôè
327,5,I wish I could reach more viewers
328,1,"La nouvelle police de caract√®re est atroce. Au moins, laissez-nous le choix de choisir entre la nouvelle et l‚Äôancienne. Je ne l‚Äôappr√©cie pas du tout, elle me fait mal aux yeux et √ßa ne me donne plus envie d‚Äôutiliser Instagram. Merci de changer √ßa."
329,4,"Bring back gif comments, I can‚Äôt use them anymore"
330,1,"my dms have been broken on my one account for about 2 weeks and i've reported it several times, and they have not gotten fixed. if this continues for much longer i'll be deleting the app"
331,5,Very Very
332,1,flip-side is only available for a selected group. it should be available to everyone on the app.
333,1,"Since days now I try to reach to app support, there is no way to contact them, I tried everything possible to get my app to work, nothing works, CANNOT REFRESH FEED! Even to contact support from the app is not possible. I‚Äôm a regular user, I don‚Äôt run a channel or a business on instagram, I can easily live without it. I deleted the app but still feel the need to say what‚Äôs wrong with it just in case someone else is struggling with the same issue."
334,5,my note‚Äôs are not showing up all updates have been done
335,1,Please let us use GIFS again. That‚Äôs my fave way to comment on posts üò•
336,1,Bug affecting stories that glitch jumps to ads between one persons story. Many video stories stuck on load even with strong connection. After swiping through stories for a minute or two it completely freezes and I need to relaunch the app
337,1,It is hard for older people.  I don‚Äôt like it
338,5,pls add the option to transfer already posted posts to ur flipside while keeping the original date it was posted üò≠ i cant have ppl knowing that im not nonchalant and mysterious anymore
339,2,New update won‚Äôt let me upload anything
340,5,Only thing I would love to see is an improved performance of the App and maybe the AI that meta uses to suggest posts.
341,2,"everyone else i know has the flipside feature on their account, i‚Äôve uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and updated it over and over again but i still don‚Äôt have it"
342,1,Can‚Äôt view saved posts after updating
343,1,"I've noticed that my comments are consistently being removed, and it's becoming quite frustrating. Even when I'm simply asking questions or sharing thoughts, they seem to disappear, and I receive a violation notice. I make sure my comments are always respectful and friendly, so I'm puzzled as to why this keeps happening. It's disheartening not to receive specific feedback on why they're removed, and not being able to appeal adds to the frustration. Interaction is a crucial aspect of the app experience, and when it feels restricted, it takes away from the enjoyment. I would greatly appreciate it if this issue could be addressed. Thank you for your attention to this matter."
344,5,I love the options. Beginner friendly
345,2,Will not load or open 8/10 tries. Can not access the people I follow.
346,1,Bring back recent posts on hashtags!!! No one can gain any following/attention like this at all unless you had a following ages ago. None of my posts ever show up in hashtags cause of this. Bring back the original instagram you‚Äôre just doing more harm than good for the company.
347,1,my gif option is gone.
348,1,Gif option no longer available in comment section
349,5,This app is destroying our brains.
350,5,"One of the best Social Apps imo, you have everything you need and the looks of it are great. Not to mention that no other app besides Tiktok and Instagram seems like an up to date Social. 10/10"
351,1,i can‚Äôt login my account in my insta application
352,1,"How is it possible that after I don‚Äôt know how many years of this app existing, you‚Äôre still having issues when saving stories. The sound is delayed. Always. And when recording videos with headphones on, the audio is delayed as well. How can you be so incompetent? Video and sound is literally what you do."
353,3,Need ipad version ASAP
354,1,"Instagram has not been letting me log in the last month through the app on my phone, but when i log into other devices or a browser it lets me in no problem"
355,3,"Over the past few versions of updates for this application, I‚Äôve been experiencing videos where image and sound are lagging. A video will start, and the image will continue while the sound will restart from the beginning of the video, causing a very strange lag."
356,1,Instagram needs belp
357,1,"Every time I try to log into my account it keeps saying sorry , there was a problem with you request and I already tried everything , from vpn to making a new account to logging in with Facebook to even making a new account nothing works"
358,1,"The new update brought dissatisfaction and frustration when i saw that gif commenting was not a thing anymore, i am now only able to react with my avatar, which is very very dumb."
359,5,"can you guys add a feature thing where we could edit our stories that we already posted? like things in our highlights. removing music or adding music, adding texts, etc. some of my
old stories i dont like the music but want to keep it in my highlights but i cant edit it."
360,1,"Hello, randomly my instagram app logged me out and every time I try to log into the app I get an error message. I can log in in my computer and a mobile browsing window and my account is fine but the app just wont work for me. What is going on?? Instagram support is none existent so I am stuck with something I cant really use anymore and my business and career relies on Instagram."
361,5,Great app
362,1,I updated the app & now every single video freezes. Thanks Instagram
363,1,FK this app they removed gifs on comments
364,1,Instagram won‚Äôt let me post to my story!
365,1,I‚Äôve always used gifs like many others and now there gone if you see this please make the same review
366,5,Love Instagram. I think a good suggestion would be being able to delete a single picture from a multiple picture post without having to delete the whole post and redoing it. I posted a photo dump with a person I now do not want on my Instagram or maybe I decide I don‚Äôt like it. If we had an option to delete that single picture?? That would be amazing.
367,1,After updating the app today I am now logged out of 2 of my 3 instagram accounts and no matter what I do I can‚Äôt log in. I keep getting the ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù error. Very frustrating as I have hundreds of pictures and videos saved on those pages.
368,1,"Great app for taking photos of your food, but this algorithm clearly suppresses important, honest information in favor of genocide. Sadly in this day and age, this app is a necessary evil but every empire falls."
369,2,It‚Äôs not letting me add captions to my posts anytime I try it won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm very frustrated please fix this issue.
370,4,I request to please add a dislike button as well on Instagram please that‚Äôs a big request
371,1,Gif option gone after update ü§¨ü§¨
372,1,A great app for taking photos of your food but why actively suppress honest and important conversations in opposition to crimes against humanity?
373,1,Here‚Äôs the thing - the opportunity to censor one of the most followed and prolific photo journalists in Gaza passed a long time ago. Doing it 75 years and 150 days into a genocide only indicates one thing: Meta‚Äôs support for and attempted complicity in the Palestinian genocide.
374,1,It‚Äôs become basically just an app of advertisements and ‚Äúsuggested posts‚Äù with occasional updates from friends and accounts I follow.
375,1,i HATE and i mean absolutely HATE with every fibre of my being the auto refresh feature on the home feed instagram has!!!! GET RID OF IT i can never get through and entire feed without it freshreshing on me and i lose every thing freaking make it stop!!!!!
376,1,"This app is disgusting. Full of young girls who are like 14 max dressing like modern day women‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking about model style skimpy clothes and makeup and doing dances. Followed by countless creeps commenting love emojis and such, drooling over these children. I get my account suspended for commenting and calling out the child porn. Instagram advocating and normalizing child porn and pedophilia in society"
377,1,account was hacked the attacker set up 2 factor authentication and Instagram won‚Äôt help me get my account back
378,1,"Uhhhh, this is the only social media app I use for more than 10 years and I started deactivating it a lot since I started hating it!
There is no snooze option for all the suggestions and I can‚Äôt deal with it, it‚Äôs so annoying. Sorry Instagram, you disappeared me, you shouldn‚Äôt have done this."
379,5,Instagram is a app where you can express yourself.
380,5,"Love this app. I have more than one account and can switch easily back and forth.

I just wish they would bring back the sorting feature ‚Äúmost resent‚Äô instead of ‚Äúresent top posts‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt necessary show the last posts üòí"
381,1,For some unknown reason Instagram thinks I‚Äôm breaking rules and keeps blocking me from posting for a week at a time.  For the life of me I can‚Äôt figure out why.   There is no rhyme or reason for it.
382,1,"Ku explore page is broken, keeps showing me things that I‚Äôm not interested in. Content in other languages that I have no clue or interest."
383,1,I‚Äôve been trying to make a poll in a DM group chat for a few days but it doesnt work - there‚Äôs a red x and it says ‚ÄúFailed to send message‚Äù. Please fix this
384,1,Do not recommend this app either again do to all the fake profiles! Meta needs to do serious updates so people feel safe using their Facebook apps!
385,2,I‚Äôm gaining followers everyday but insight shows I‚Äôm losing.
386,1,"Have u ever had the experience that talking over phone about something and seeing advertisements about it in fb or insta? If they collect and sell our data, what else they do to our human interactions?

If I quiet the app, I only disadvantage myself, but if we all do it and put our smart phones off for a day or week then the genuine interaction could happen (w/o all those unnecessary complexity the app provides)."
387,1,Took away the ability to comment gifts after new app update would give negative stars if possible
388,1,"App is worst at all . 
I tried two weeks to login my account with correct password but it was showing an problem occurred after this it asked me to change password then I tried but links were not working at all.
Poor service as compared to name of this app.
Sorry to say but app is very poor ."
389,1,"Spam bot deletes any helpful and positive and supportive comments I make in posts while leaving up abusive, ableist, racist, and various phobic comments. I have even personally gone out of my way to experiment and saying the R word is fine, but giving advice is not. Absolutely ridiculous. Absolute cesspool of a website."
390,1,I have a one insta page and I don‚Äôt know it doesn‚Äôt show in my friends and relatives account.
391,1,"Instagram search has always been tricky to use, but now it's outright useless. Instead of relevant posts and comments, I'm seeing posts from 5 years ago :( 

It's frustrating because:

1. most of the Suggested page (+ recommended posts, + comments sections) are showing outdated or irrelevant content

2. when searching for posts related to current events (for example: fashion week), I can't filter by date so the results are also outdated or irrelevant

Maybe they're trying to be more like Pinterest search results? But pinterest is more of a portfolio-based system, whereas instagram is used as social media for community building....

I'm reviewing because I'm upset by whatever this update is doing to the app. Makes it less functional as social media and ultimately makes me wish for another new social media app that Meta doesn't have its claws in.

Someone else just remake instagram pleaseüôÑ"
392,1,"Why aren‚Äôt the dates on posts showing? Please show them. It‚Äôs annoying, sneaky, and feels disrespectful that the app just changed that with no apparent way to fix it."
393,5,So good üòä
394,5,Freedom
395,1,"Should be able to add music to a post, even if there are videos. You should be able to turn off the sound of video and add music. Not sure if my version is not updated, but I also tried to update my version and it seemed I could not, not sure if there is a way to make it easier to update?"
396,2,"What is wrong with this trash app already? This problem is not new judging from online complaints. Meta doesn‚Äôt have the money?

Funny how the ads never stall‚Ä¶"
397,1,"So many bugs, I have had to delete and redownload the app many times every week. 

Some issues on what is not working: 

- stories from accounts I follow are no longer showing up at the top of my feed. 

- cannot send gifs anymore, the button completely disappeared. 

- professional dashboard rarely loads stating ‚Äú an error occurred try again later‚Äù 

- chats do not load most current conservation, stuck and won‚Äôt load, always have to reset phone and delete redownload app to fix this. 

- if I comment or @ a person Instagram immediately throws me in jail, this has happened twice now. 

Such a frustrating app, with no help on the horizon."
398,5,ü´∂
399,1,"But onlyfans girls can funnel their business through this and x. It‚Äôs so sad, how racism and oppression is so existent on these apps"
400,5,"Hey!
Firstly thank you so much who invented Instagram for us to share our stories, thoughts, ideas and many more things.
I really appreciate your work and briefly detailed things like in story there is lot of options of music, template, effects on picture, mention any legend or celebrity and many more things are there. Also if someone has problems then easily shake the phone and send them. In few days it solved our problems. Very fast response you give us.
I don‚Äôt know how I explain my love to you.
I love Instagram so much‚ù§Ô∏è(really can‚Äôt explain)
If any day i am not active on Instagram, it means I passed away.
Reels, stories and access to each and every person of our beautiful world.
INSTAGRAM is a brand like it joined each and every community on earth. 
Thank you for make me so happy ‚ù§Ô∏è"
401,1,"I‚Äôm Muslim and they‚Äôre not allowing me to upload any Islamic content, they just take it down for ‚ÄúHate speech‚Äù like how is Islam hate speech INSTAGRAM?!!!!"
402,3,"Twitter can do a competent iPad app, why can't instagram. You have a web software format that would translate perfectly, yet it hasn't happened yet."
403,1,I updated my app and now there‚Äôs no more notes‚Ä¶
404,1,I can't even access my account from the app
405,2,Recently the notes feature and the edit messages feature has been removed which is really annoying. Those were really good features that i used all the time and i just want them backüò≠üôè
406,1,Instagram please fix this issue I can‚Äôt add new accounts or log into my main account with the app anymore I have to do it on a browser and after you fix that I will rate this a 5 star app
407,5,i love it
408,5,Instagram is one of the best apps ever
409,1,"The app is not offering English translation on many posts written in Arabic.  It is also choking or snuffing out the voices of doctors and journalists in Gaza.  I was naive to think this app was a resource for truth and at the very least: a resource for the people suffering most on our planet.  Instead of providing them a lifeline of communication, Meta is  attempting to silence people crying out for help‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs criminal and heartbreaking."
410,1,return the translate button. no one can translate any languages outside of english. that isn't slick.
411,2,"Just got a new iPhone, and it‚Äôs not allowing me access to my photos. I click the link that shoots me to settings and there‚Äôs not a full access option. Not sure what to do or how to fix the issue. I run a small business and I can‚Äôt afford to not post/ advertise."
412,5,"I love ig, let us put  more pictures then 10 slides"
413,1,I can‚Äôt even get in most days! Then some days I get on and then it kicks me out of the app. The past 2 days I haven‚Äôt been able to get on the app. I‚Äôve restarted my phone and updated the phone. My friend was having the same problem with there app also!
414,1,Give us back seeing recents on tags!
415,1,Your AI police is way out of hand. I took several weeks off because of the fact that I couldn‚Äôt type anything because you guys blocked me from commenting without anything showing in my violations. I am just done. No more Instagram.
416,5,Give me back my notes
417,5,Share my story with people that make me happy
418,1,Instagram revoked my gif rights
419,2,"Its been a year and I still haven‚Äôt gotten notes, being able to add a song on post with multiple photos and other sorts. It is disappointing for the fact that instagram will do nothing to fix bugs like this, no other app I have had this issue and I hope that instagram will fix bugs and do better.
Thank you"
420,5,Y did you guys take my notes away after updating my app !!!
421,3,I‚Äôm only giving a 3 cause where did my notes go!!!! There gone! I need it back so I can see what doing! Please
422,1,There‚Äôs no way this app went from performing so great to being updated with bare minimum fixes in game! Every video literally buffers and I can‚Äôt enjoy any content wether it‚Äôs on Instagram directly or Facebook!
423,2,"Bring notes back before I bomb the insta headquarters(just a joke not serious at all), the notes were so cool, now my insta looks naked, PUT ITS CLOTHES BACK ON!!!"
424,5,I love the ways of how it work for a business and the value of the images
425,2,WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS UPDATE I JUST WANNA USE MY NOTED AND SPEED UP REELS
426,1,I can‚Äôt even scroll anymore literally nothing plays through it just glitches ALL THE TIME‚Ä¶
427,1,Now my notes feature has disappeared and it happens every few months.
428,1,"This company is just so absurdly horrendous in so many ways. Also, they have downright porn allowed on this app. Absolutely disgusting. Child porn links, as well with absolutely detestable creeps allowed to lurk around."
429,4,Hello! You should make a tan that shows who is not following you back so you have the option to unfollow all of the clout chasers.
430,3,I deleted my account
431,5,The best app to share content in real time
432,1,"My account has been hacked for months and insta doesn‚Äôt do shiett, download at ur own risk"
433,2,My comments keep getting taken down for absolutely no reason saying I violated IG guidelines but surely others can post racist comments. All the artists I follow are posting less content due to their guidelines or hardly see them since they get shadow banned. I can‚Äôt post gifs anymore in comment sections. I also get my stories taken down due to sharing explicit content when it‚Äôs just art meanwhile they let chicks with bogus bbls and ridiculous breast implants in micro bathing suits post on a daily basis.
434,1,I am a iPad user I am not able to use a phone due to removal of posting on your story with a iPad. It is very hard to enjoy this app and collaborate with others.
435,1,"I admit it. I‚Äôm addicted and check Instagram on average 5 or 6 times a day. I‚Äôve always used the ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù option available, but out of nowhere  it disappeared today and my feed is all over the place. A post from 3 mins ago, followed by one and hour ago, then one from 3 days ago. I can‚Äôt begin to describe the anxiety this app is giving me now. It‚Äôs basically useless until this is fixed."
436,1,Until the other day you could tap the Instagram button at the top left and choose to see the accounts you actually follow instead of accounts that make Instagram the most money. No longer. Guess I will no longer be using Instagram.
437,5,"This is a new adventure for me, but I‚Äôm enjoying the journey day by day.  Thanks for all your support!"
438,1,The AI used to curate content on Instagram flags comments as ‚Äúviolating community guidelines for spam‚Äù and removes said content without posts actually meeting the definition for ‚Äúspam‚Äù. Meanwhile actual spam with bots demanding people click links for money are all over the place. Broken and aweful
439,5,"Hello, I‚Äôm having trouble clicking ‚Äústories template‚Äù and somehow said ‚Äú Couldn't add to template 
Something went wrong. This template is currently unavailable for you to add to.‚Äù If anyone knows how pleaseeeeee let me knowwww 
Thank you!‚ú®"
440,2,Why come you remove the notes from everyone?
441,4,"Instagram is a pretty good app but when new updates come, I‚Äôm always the last to get it like there was recently update where you get to like peoples notes and I have yet to receive it and I‚Äôve updated my phone and the app multiple times. Also people have been able to put voice messages on their notes and I haven‚Äôt been able too"
442,3,Title says it all. Doesn‚Äôt work well.
443,1,"My notes keep
disappearing fix it !"
444,1,It‚Äôs unbelievable every time there‚Äôs an update on this trash app even on a WiFi connection stories don‚Äôt want to upload! IG used to be a great app until Meta took over!!!!
445,4,Why every time I scroll with my volume down it has to go all the way up then back down again?
446,5,This app is perfect for those tick-tock lovers
447,3,"Instagram is a good app, you can do all of the most basic social features on it like posting and direct messages but if you‚Äôre trying to be a creator you‚Äôll be disappointed‚Ä¶ Regardless of if you spend hours editing a post and put effort into it to make it high quality, Instagram may never even push your post out to be seen and help you grow. Unfortunate, but still a good app"
448,1,"After i worked on my account 5 years ,paying a lot of money to sponsor my posts , then suddenly they disabled my account . Their reason is , I didn‚Äôt follow their rules without telling what was it. I asked experts they said sometimes they do this by mistake , and its happening a lot lately. What a shame !"
449,1,Instagram promotes pedophilia by showing reels and suggesting profiles of teenage girls to men in their 50‚Äôs.
450,5,Classless Act is definitely in their own league. Always Innovative and The energy is BarNone to any other band in this era. Play it Strong and Original Classless Act
451,5,"My favorite app to share memorias with family friends, private conversations or public."
452,5,instagram notes gone
453,1,"You all keep removing my notes on my account, I don‚Äôt know why but I really dislike it. If you choose to fix it my @ are 

@0fficially_cara 
@heavyon_cara"
454,5,It‚Äôs a great app?!
455,1,"It‚Äôs a genuine concern , I used to have many views on my profile now I was to pay to even be seen like wow , how last century is that . Like consumerism/ capitalism don‚Äôt know her nor support her ."
456,3,"Dear instagram, the stories are not uploading when i add music to it‚Ä¶."
457,1,"In random censorship by people who don‚Äôt understand English apparently. And who hate anything that‚Äôs even mildly conservative in thought. don‚Äôt recognize authentic speech, but only see attempts to be misleading. Instagram folks, you don‚Äôt know peoples intent when they post. You should learn to be non-biased but I‚Äôll bet you can‚Äôt."
458,1,This update got rid of the notes on my Instagram.
459,1,"anytime I try to share a story, the people who I contact most are no longer at the top suggestions. please fix this new update. it‚Äôs really annoying."
460,3,Please please please let me mute reels again why did you get rid of that feature!!!!!!
461,4,"I‚Äôve had the app for a couple years now and it‚Äôs honestly great, but over the past year or 2 I wasn‚Äôt able to do ‚ÄúAdd mine‚Äù, or currently post notes, even after reaching out and asking why. Also, Instagram has deleted some of my post as soon as I post it. Other than that, the app is great it just needs some help‚Ä¶"
462,3,this app is good but if I delete or deactivate my account my notes suddenly go away I don‚Äôt have notes still and I want this update too!
463,4,"I cant see/ put notes, i keep refreshing the app and i even deleted it for over an hour then got it back. it is on both of my accounts and i really don‚Äôt appreciate this... please fix all of this, this instant."
464,1,why can‚Äôt you guys give us a preview of the update before we update it bc i updated it thinking the update was gonna be amazing but no it‚Äôs absolutely trash and i want the old version back immediately like this is update is actually so bad can u guys give me back the normal one i just had like oml
465,1,"Half the reason I even open this app is to set the little status in the messaging section, and now my only reason for opening the app is responding to messages from people I can just text or snap. This update is an absolutely INSANE move, makes the app worse, and deserves criticism. Mark ought to be put on trial before the shareholders."
466,3,Consistency is ridiculous. Paid promo is a scam.
467,2,my notes keep disappearing. it‚Äôs kinda of annoying üòë
468,1,I can‚Äôt see my notes for some reason I was seeing them but it‚Äôs been a minute since I seen it
469,5,Where are they notes? My friends have them but not me???
470,1,"Instagram is such a biased uninformed Social Platform. The censor on things, like religion, that they obviously know nothing about. They block accurate information and their algorithms is nothing but reflective of biased liberal ideology."
471,1,BRO WHY ARENT ALL THE FEATURES AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE? IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE.
472,5,Hey thanks instagram!! You are awesome. Allowing me to connect everywhere :)
473,3,"Not a fan.  Nevermind the fact that IG doesn't offer the ability to translate DM's (it is awful at translating comments anyway), but now they have hidden the ""copy"" button, so when I am talking to someone internationally, I now have to make one extra click for every translation I do.... which is a lot.  The messages and the annoyance add/s up.  Further to that, the entire menu structure has been redone, and now some options are just gone completely.  Stop fixing what isn't broken.  If you want to do something meaningful, hook into Google Translate and offer translations on-the-fly.  I'd even pay for this."
474,2,"Hi! Since I had instagram for 5 years and since Notes was added recently, I‚Äôve been having problems with it and I‚Äôm tired of it disappearing and I done everything to fix it but it never seems to work and I would like a solution to fix the issue as I know other people is going through this too. I hope that it‚Äôll be resolved and improved!"
475,3,I love Instagram and I especially like the notes feature but it never works. It randomly disappears or removes the music feature and Instagram has no customer support so I never get an answer to why. And the funniest thing about this is that it only happens to one of my accounts (I have 2). Please fix this Instagram.

482,3,"I love instagram, I really do. But they had a new update, and when updating my app, I had open it when done. And realized they had took notes away. This is not funny or acceptable. Notes was a way to express myself. With music or little notes ."
483,1,"This used to be my favorite app. I loved seeing what my friends were up to, and following creators I found interesting. Well! With the newer model, I literally have come to hate this app. They limited access to people I follow ON PURPOSE and replaced them with a bunch of content from people I don‚Äôt know, and don‚Äôt care about. The ads are annoying, but I get it‚Äôs a business. It‚Äôs more them force feeding a curated experience I have no interest in. I like the messaging system, and stories are still cool. But I am seriously considering deleting this app. As it is no longer at ALL what I had originally used it for."
