Overview
The Automated Review Rating System is designed to analyze customer reviews and automatically assign a rating (e.g., 1â€“5 stars). It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment and classify reviews into appropriate rating categories. This helps businesses quickly understand customer feedback without manually going through thousands of reviews.

Features
- Sentiment analysis of text reviews
- Automatic star rating prediction
- Preprocessing of noisy text (stop words, punctuation, slang)
